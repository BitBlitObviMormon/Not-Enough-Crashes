Not Enough crashes is a Fabric mod that improves crashes in Minecraft. It was originally developed as [TooManyCrashes](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/toomanycrashes) by Runemoro. This is a working port of it for Minecraft 1.15+ with slight fixes and additions.
Features include:

- When crashing, you can go back to the title screen and keep playing, without needing to restart.
- A convenient way to submit syntax-highlighted crash reports via a special crash screen.
- Display a list of mods that were involved in the crash, and can be clicked to go to their issue tracker.

- More useful stack traces that are deobfuscated and include additional information such as NBT for mod developers.

Not Enough Crashes is also useful in development environments. See the [Github README](https://github.com/natanfudge/Not-Enough-Crashes).
